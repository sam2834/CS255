The DriverPass project is a system for online driving tests and in-person driving lessons. The client wanted a streamlined web-based app that could track appointment and DMV practice test be adaptable to changes in user access and DMV policy change.
In this project, I learned a great deal about visualizing system requirements so that changes to a system can be made more easily and developers can quickly proceed to the problem and build solutions.
If I were to revise any part of my work, it would be the diagrams. With a little extra visualization of the software, I could create more thorough diagrams that better help the developer.
I viewed the user's needs in terms of what I know about security in an online system and how code works. It's important to think about things this way because attempting to visualize a system without knowing anything about how to actually build it is counterproductive.
I view designing software as sort of like building a house. The first thing needing to be done is writing a blueprint where this project involved making many diagrams. From there, each piece can be accomplished perfectly as long the blueprint is followed with each piece's function in mind. If I was wiring a house I would not just be ensuring that I installed the correct wire and that it ran to the correct points but also that it did not interfere with any other parts of the house's design.
